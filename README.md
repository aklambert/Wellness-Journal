# Wellness Journal
Wellness Journal is a mobile app that is meant to hold features pertaining to fitness tracking and journaling all in one place. It was inspired by a desire to build a custom workout builder app that also included journaling feautures.

In this app, there are some exercise/fitness related functions such as saving custom workouts, custom exercises, and tracking workout progress. There is also a timer that can be used for focusing, reminders to stand, etc. to encourage healthy habits for anyone who works at a desk a lot. Additionally, there are some journaling features to encourage healthy mental wellbeing, along with goal tracking features.

This app is still in its initial version, and it has primarily served as an educational project. Various new technologies were learned and applied throughout development, such as the Kotlin programming language, Android's Room persistent library for database management, and independently applying learned software engineering prinicples and best practices.
