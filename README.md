# Wellness Journal
Wellness Journal is a mobile app that is meant to hold features pertaining to fitness tracking and journaling all in one place. This idea was inspired by wanting to build an app that combined features pertaining to exercise tracking and mental wellness all in one place with nice UI/ UX design. There are many fitness apps and many mental wellness and journaling apps, but there do not appear to be many free apps that contain both fitness features and journaling features.

In Wellness Journal, there will be some exercise/fitness related functions such as saving custom workouts and exercises, tracking exercise progress, tracking weight and calculating BMI, and tracking hydration. There will also be an interval timer people can use for focusing, reminders to stand, etc. to encourage healthy habits for anyone who works at a desk a lot. Additionally, there will be some journal features to encourage healthy mental wellbeing, along with goal tracking features.
